## 提示词

```text
Use case: stylized-concept. Generate one inventory illustration for 金蛇剑 (eq_jinshejian), 兵器·剑, 天 tier. Provenance context: Sword Stained with Royal Blood, Golden Snake Gentleman; late-Ming story context 1630-1645; exact form pending textual verification and visual treatment is original. The two attached approved item baselines control style only: crisp fine dark-gray ink outlines, thin transparent color washes, restrained hand-painted brushwork, low-saturation cool-warm color, and a warm light-gray near-ivory background. Never copy either reference object, silhouette, fittings, composition, color layout, wear pattern, sword design, or book design. Generate an entirely new composition. Subject: one complete distinctive gold-toned Chinese sword whose serpent idea is concentrated in a sinuous but functional guard, pommel and shallow decorative spine rhythm; the continuous steel cutting edges remain clearly readable and usable. Any unspecified material, ornament, proportion or wear is an original wuxia extension, not a claimed novel illustration or historical reconstruction. Effect fields inform function only; never draw stats, text, icons or supernatural effects. Grade language: exceptionally rare material, a complete distinctive silhouette, dense controlled craftsmanship and cool or warm natural luster; prestigious but restrained, never magical or self-luminous. Grade is expressed only through material, workmanship and preservation. Style: non-photographic and non-3D, clear fine ink contours, thin translucent washes, restrained visible brushwork and clear material boundaries. Lighting is soft from upper left, with only narrow subdued highlights on the object itself and no glow. Composition: 1:1 square, requested 1536x1536, exactly one coherent inventory item centered diagonally or in the clearest natural arrangement, gentle three-quarter view with minimal foreshortening. The entire point, head, shaft end, handle, pommel, tip, chain or cloth edge must be visible. Keep at least 18 percent clear margin on every side where geometry allows; object bounding box must not exceed 76 percent of canvas width or height. No person, hand, rack, scene, floor, ground or shadow. Background: uniform warm light gray near ivory, RGB approximately 230,225,216, with no texture, vignette, gradient, ground plane or contact shadow. Completely unlettered. Item-specific exclusions: No literal full snake animal, forked tongue blade, violently wavy flame blade, toy gold, emerald eyes, neon, poison mist or copied screen design. Absolutely no text, pseudo-writing, numerals, seal, signature, logo, watermark text, UI, border, grade frame, collage, multi-view, cropping, broken tip, modern material, specific film or game weapon design, actor, artist, anime, European fantasy, steampunk, Japanese sword, long European crossguard, giant gem, hamon, Damascus swirl, serration, fire blade, neon, bloom, magic circle, aura, colored light column, blood, person, hand, weapon rack, display pedestal, scene, floor, ground, contact shadow, cast shadow, extra unrelated object, duplicate weapon, photographic realism or 3D-render appearance. Preserve any tool-native provenance marker; do not fabricate or erase it. REPAIR PRIORITY: the first candidate was otherwise correct but too large. Generate a fresh composition, not an edit. Make the entire object markedly smaller and center it. Keep every extreme endpoint inside the central 16%-84% rectangle, target at least 18% empty background on all four sides, and keep the visible-object bounding box at or below 64% of both canvas width and height. Do not add, remove, coil, bend or shorten parts to achieve this; preserve the complete named form. SEMANTIC REPAIR: the first candidate violated the exclusion by depicting a literal snake. Do not draw any snake head, eyes, mouth, animal body, scales or recognizable whole serpent. Express the Golden Snake identity only as abstract shallow sinuous metal rhythms in the guard, pommel and spine decoration while keeping a practical continuous steel blade.
